|Assignment 1: Poster  | This industry talk has introduced me to the diverse jobs availbale in the IT sector ranging from UI/UX designer, QA tester to web developer, andriod developer,etc. We got to learn the job scopes of some of the jobs and the tools they regularly use. It also taught me that in this field, even after finishing university we need to continue learning new things. As a first year student in software engineering this was a valuable experience. |
| Assignment 2: Video | This is a video we made after our visit to UTM Digital, where we were shown around the different divisions and got to communicate with the people working there and get to experience the work environment of this industry. Before the visit, we had a webinar hosted by the UTM Digital so we were even more looking forward to the visit. Getting to interview the people there was enlightening. The most interesting part was visiting the data center where we were not allowed to take any pictures. It was amazing to hear about the many different security measures and precautions taken to keep the system running smoothly.

| Assignment 3: Report | It was interesting to learn about the system development process of Credence and hear an alumni talk about her experience of working in this industry. This has inspired me to look forward to the day I have enough skills to venture into developing systems myself and made me look forward to my studies and have a resolve to work even harder in learning and gaining knowledge.|
| Assignment 4: Newsletter | The industry tour this time was a great way to show us students how our workplaces might look if we succeed in securing jobs in this sector. We got first hand detailed experience on what kind of work we would be expected to do and got valuable advice from industry seniors on how to improve ourselves and stand out in this industry. Moreover, I feel like this visit rekindled the passion inside me to become a skilled programmer and challenge myself. |
| Design Thinking Project | It was a great experience to do this project with my fellow classmates. This was the first time I had to work with a team through so many stages of the project. It was a satisfying experience to see each of the phases getting completed and seeing our various ideas coming together and solidifying. Through this project I had to do a lot of teamwork, and it was great to see how the seemingly difficult tasks became easier when we all broke it down and attempted it together. The design thinking process gave me a glimpse into how to develop app interfaces keeping the users in mind. |
| PC Assemble Lab  | On November 2, we had a lab class for Technology and Information System where we had to take apart a pc and then reassembled it. We were taken to the lab and seperated into groups and each group had to disassemble a PC. Then, we were told to compete on which group gets to re-assemble the PC the fastest and successfully make it turn on. Afterwards, we had a quiz on the topic to check our understanding of the topic. I like that we had such a hands on experience dealing with the computer hardware. As computer science students, it lets us closely get used to the different components of PC hardware and familiarizes us with assesmbling it so that it works. I look forward to similar lab classes in the future as it was a fun experience.  |
