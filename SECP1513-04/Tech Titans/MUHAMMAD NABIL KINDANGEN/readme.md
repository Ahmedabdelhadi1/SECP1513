| 1 | Assignment 1 | This virtual meeting with the CEO of CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD was quite informative. Thanks to his comprehensive overview of the company's history, I now have a better knowledge of how the modern IT industry functions. The CEO's thorough descriptions of technologies like CHATGPT aroused my curiosity, especially when we talked about AI. He shared the company's knowledge in this field and dug deep into the question of whether AI may someday replace humans, which opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. This conference made me realize how vital it is to have a solid grasp of the subject matter in the rapidly evolving disciplines of science and technology, in addition to keeping up with current trends. |
| 2 | Assignment 2 | I will always remember how much fun it was to explore the UTM Digital building at the school. Because of the professors' passionate support in helping us understand their working environment and the fantastic meeting places and leisure options, I felt that there was a dynamic and creative academic culture. The in-depth descriptions of databases provided by the teachers, particularly on the database floor, helped me to comprehend this crucial subject matter better. Although I was unable to take any photos, I was able to gain a better understanding of the school's IT system and the instructors' experience, which will serve to inspire me in my future coursework and career. |
| 3 | Assignment 3 | I'm having to reevaluate my four-year goal to become a system developer in light of the industry changes that were covered in the session. This has caused me to reevaluate my goals for success in this field. My biggest realization is that it's critical to adapt to new software since computer science is a field that is always evolving. To aid with this, I'm considering utilizing a number of online tools, such as Udemy, to allow self-directed education. I also plan to tackle a range of programming assignments to improve my critical thinking abilities, since I believe this is a necessary prerequisite for becoming a proficient system developer. |
| 4 | Assignment 4 | I was able to obtain a greater grasp of computer science—which includes several subfields including web and mobile development, database design, QA, and design—by taking part in the visit to CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD arranged by UTM. At the same time, I also got to meet eager seniors from the same school. This field study expanded my professional horizons and fueled my desire to advance in my job. I am really appreciative of the organization for its careful breakfast preparation, which had a significant impact on both my academic and professional journeys. Our in-depth talk with the CEO provided me with valuable career counsel that inspired me to aggressively pursue professional progress. This unique experience has made me feel more ready to take on the difficulties in my future career. Additionally, this visit greatly |
| 5 | PC Assembly | I really like the PC Assembly exercise, which was my introduction to computer hardware. It was really educational to have hands-on experience constructing and dismantling a PC, including handling the casing, connections, power supply, RAM, HDD, and CPU fan. The significance of possessing a well-rounded understanding of both software and hardware for prospective computer science students was highlighted by this exercise. |
| 6 | Design Thinking | The artificial intelligence-focused effort goes beyond merely imparting ideation skills. It was a rewarding experience that improved my communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork abilities. These are really helpful as I want to work as a software engineer and need to be able to program well in order to give them the best possible solutions. |
