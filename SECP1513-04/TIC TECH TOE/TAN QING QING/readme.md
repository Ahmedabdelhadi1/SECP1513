| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From this industrial talk, I got information about Clarity Techworks, such as the year their company opened and their history of these years. Moreover, I learned that we have to learn programming by ourselves, even after we've finished our university studies and stepped into work life. This is because the times are constantly developing, and programming is also advancing with the times. Only by constantly learning new programming can we keep up with the times and create new technologies together. Not only that, but I also learned that we must be responsible in everything we do. In the days to come, we must try our best to complete everything and solve every problem we face, because no one has the obligation to solve these problems for us. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | From this industrial visit, I have a better understanding of our UTM Digital. I learned that they are working hard to improve the working environment to make it more convenient and smarter. They used a smart technology, the Huawei Smart Board, which can link to many devices at the same time, allowing them to better conduct their meetings. Not only that, I also learned that everyone has their own responsibility. We must fulfill our responsibilities well and cannot underestimate them. For example, the staff of the UTM Data Center have a very important responsibility. They must ensure the security of data to prevent data loss or leakage.   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mvdIr2ND6KDVXZv7Soc6UHQ7nUhDoaTA?usp=sharing | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | The speaker made me understand that, as a student who wants to become a system developer in the next four years, I must have the strength and determination to face my faults and difficulties while studying and at my internship, and I also must refrain from being scared to ask questions when I don't understand something. Not only that, but we need to grab all opportunities that occur; this will help us become more professional and effective. A variety of opportunities can assist us in improving our values. In addition, I discovered that I should never stop improving my communication skills. Good communication skills can help us handle various interpersonal connections more effectively and seek help when we face troubles | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | Visiting Clarity Techworks left a lasting memory for us. The thing that motivated me most was a talk from Mr. Yee. He really benefits us a lot. I also admire every member of this company. Their dedication and professionalism make me want to be like them. This visit also helped me a lot, allowing me to have a better understanding of the Information Technology (IT) and what I want when deciding on my future career. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | From the PC Assemble quiz, I learned how to disassemble and assemble a PC. During the disassembly process, every step must be done carefully, and the parts must be placed in a visible position and classified in order to ensure the position of the parts and avoid the loss of parts. During the assembly process, we must ensure that parts such as screws are locked so as not to cause the parts to become loose and unable to operate. From this test, I also better understood the names and uses of various parts. |
| 6 | Design Thinking Project | My goal with regard to this course is to become more proficient at coding and learn more about information technology. I also want to get more opportunities that can improve my skills and help me decide my future career. Through this project on design thinking, I improved my skills, such as communication skills, thinking skills, and so on. This design thinking helps me learn about the Internet of Things (IoT). It also helps me improve my creativity and helps me understand the importance of teamwork better. The plan necessary for me to improve my potential in the industry is that I'll do more studies about information technology and do more research about software engineering, which is the program that I study at present. I'll keep improving my coding skills too, learning programming languages as much as I can. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZ7q_m9VGeYJ_lQzetsws1TDdIcyaAQb?usp=sharing |
