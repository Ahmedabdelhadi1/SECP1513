| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | The first assignment given was to design a poster about a virtual industrial talk in Clarity Techworks. It was relatively easy for me since I've finished a lot of posters in the past, so the first task is straightforward in general. For our teamwork, as it was our first group assignment, we managed to work as a unit, even though this was our first time being together as a group.  | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Making a VLOG to UTM Digital was our second assignment, it was a very interesting activity for me as I hadn't gotten a chance to visit it. During this assignment, I found it hard for me to take good videos as I didnâ€™t have any chance to learn them. But, with my friend's help, I managed to improve a little bit by being a cameraman and increasing my video editing skills.

| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Regarding the third project, we have to write a report on an industrial talk that was delivered by Credence, a company I've never heard of. I gained knowledge about System Development at Credence through this presentation, which was delivered by an experienced AI operation. I was able to learn a lot about data analysis and system development via this session, which could potentially assist me achieve the career of my dreams in the future. | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | I gained a new experience in writing a new format of a report which is a Newsletter about the visit to Clarity Techworks located at Sunway Bigbox. This was the most exciting visit I had in my life as I never had a chance to visit the offices of software developers. Thanks to this visit, I gained the gist of experience about how an environment in the office. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | This exercise has been quite helpful in teaching me the fundamentals of PC components and how to install and uninstall them. These activities have helped me become a careful person during the assembly and disassembly of PCs as they could break if the components were not handled carefully. Lastly, it could become handy in customizing my PC for playing games. |
